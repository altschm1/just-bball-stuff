  <h1>Glossary</h1>
  <p class="alert alert-danger">Please Note: First, these stats are only recorded for centers/bigs because these specific stats are really only relevant for centers/bigs (unless future research proves otherwise).  That said, rim protection from guards/wings is still an important concept, it just comes in other/much-harder-to-quantify forms: good rotational defense from good stunts to deter drives, tagging rollers, sinking in to cover unguarded lob threats, and good on-ball defense like containing drives one-on-one or being smart in how you navigate on ball and off ball screens.  Second, these stats do not encompass all of rim protection as a whole even for bigs.  These stats do no quantify the ability to deter shots at the rim which is an extremely important concept of rim protection as a whole.  These stats do no quantify how well you defend shots at the rim without fouling which is a really important concept of rim protection as a whole.  That said, these stats are a good start for quanitfying rim protection from bigs, just don't let it be the finish line in the discourse.</p>
